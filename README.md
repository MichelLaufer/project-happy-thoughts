# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project at the Technigo Bootcamp, we have practised React state by fetching and posting data to an API.
We've used a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. 

Tech:
<br>React.js, JavaScript(ES6), HTML, CSS</br>

I was using useState and useEffect. I created a separate component for the form in which the user can submit "happy thoughts" by writing a message in the text-area and clicking on a submit button. I created another component for "HappyPosts" (the 20 latest posts) and another component for a like-button.
