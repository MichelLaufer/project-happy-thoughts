# Happy Thoughts

This week's project at the Technigo boot camp was to create a 'happy thoughts' Twitter-like app that
can be used to post and read messages. The purpose was to practice React. 

Tech:
<br>React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML</br>

I created a form for writing and posting messages. I created buttons for sending messages and a 
'heart'-button for liking posts.
